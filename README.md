# SIZMEK-HTML5-GSAP-inPage-Polite
Polite loading rich banner that uses GSAP to be used with Sizmek ad platform.

I've tested this banner on my account and it works as intended. I've noticed you can still click on the hidden buttons before they are visible, so I may need to use autoAlpha for that.

This banner uses the `EB.init();` function from the downloadable template on Sizmek pages, but I decided to use the polite loading method, with the lazy loadScript that I'm using in the DCM banner from: http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2009/07/28/the-best-way-to-load-external-javascript/

We're still using the same CloudFlare CDN for GSAP as are the rest of the banners.

I've also used the same folder name conventions as the Sizmek template.
